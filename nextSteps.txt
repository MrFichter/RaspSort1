Page 74 of the guide shows how to make the list searchable by users.

If I want to do more investigating before I go there, I could go to
wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting and could move to the section about 
complex sorts. (I might need to read about what attrgetter and itemgetter
are first, though.) Then I could try sorting by two keys.

Actually, I read more on the page above and realized that I also need to
look above, in the section about key functions, where they create a class
Student and give each object in the class properties like name, grade, 
and age--properties they will use for sorting a few lines later. I also
read about attrgetter (a function that returns attributes of an object) and
itemgetter (a function that returns items in a list, for example).

Figuring out how to do a complex sort sounds like an especially good next
step now because it would be useful in itself and would help me to get 
better at working with objects and classes. 

I could use the Mike Dawson book as good background material. 

I will need a refresher on what __repr__(self): is all about. 
Also, in the example on the how-to-sorting page, what's the deal with
the list student_objects[]? Is it standard procedure to create a list 
containing all of the objects in a class, or it is only useful in this
situation?
