Page 74 of the guide shows how to make the list searchable by users.

Before I do that page, though, I'll try using a regular expression to get rid
of the "The" in the titles. I'll also change my for loop into list
comprehension, which @fichtitious says is more memory efficient. Right now, my
experiments with simpleSort.py have gotten list comprehension to work.

The last time I used a regular expression to get rid of something, I used
re.sub. Would that be appropriate here?
